# Space Planner

It is the year 2200. An infection in our galaxy broke loose. There are people in each of our space
stations across the solar system. This application is meant to solve and find
the best plan to recover the people from the different stations and bring them
to earth. Is takes in factors such as time, fuel consumption and refueling, and the number of ships; it then tries to find the plan with the minimal overall cost. 

## Solutions

3 situations have been fed into the planner, biggest constraint being number and size of ships, and the results have been based on that.

## Conclusion

Based on this planner, the best plan in this situation would be to use
4 smaller quicker ships, rather than 1 big slow ship or two medium ships.
